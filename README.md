# 🚀 Credit Card Approval Risk Predictor  

## 📌 Overview  

Banks process numerous credit card applications, many of which are rejected due to factors like high loan balances, low income, or multiple credit inquiries. Manually reviewing these applications is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project leverages **machine learning** to automate the approval process, mirroring real-world banking practices.
