# 🚀 Credit Card Approval Risk Predictor  

## 📌 Overview  

Banks process numerous credit card applications, many of which are rejected due to factors like high loan balances, low income, or multiple credit inquiries. Manually reviewing these applications is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project leverages **machine learning** to automate the approval process, mirroring real-world banking practices.

### In this project, we’ll be using Credit Card Approval Dataset. The structure of our project will be as follows:

- To get a basic introduction of our project & What’s the business problem associated with it ?  
- We’ll start by loading and viewing the dataset.  
- To manipulate data, if there are any missing entries in the dataset.  
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our dataset.  
- To pre-process data before applying machine learning model to the dataset.  
- To apply machine learning models that can predict if an individual’s application for a credit card will be accepted or not.
